# real-time-object-detection_BARQA
This repository provides a compact, production-minded template for real-time object detection. It captures frames from a local webcam or an RTSP/IP camera, runs inference using an Ultralytics YOLO model (e.g., yolov8n.pt), and displays annotated video with live FPS.
